		<h2 class="new-line">Westminster University Class of '26, Honors Student in Computer Science, Data Science, and Mathematics</h2>
		<p class="new-line indent">
			I'm a current student at Westminster University studying Computer Science, Data Science, and Mathematics. I am also part of the Honors
			College, the First Scholars (First Generation College Student) program, and have been on the Dean's List for all five of my semesters.
		</p>
		<p class="new-line indent">
			I've been an intern for both Ken Garff in their Data and Analytics Department and RanLife Home Loans in their Software Development
			Department. I've also worked in the Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics Tutoring Lab in the Giovale Library on campus and as an
			Undergraduate Research Assistant.
		</p>
		<p class="new-line indent">
			I also volunteer at Oakwood Elementary's Chess Club as an instructor and Co-Director. There, I sometimes run the club and manage all of
			the student volunteers. I have also been working on ChessWeb to automate updating ratings and pairings, which saves 4+ hours a week of the
			director's time.
		</p>
		<p class="new-line indent">
			I have also had the amazing opportunity to compete in HackUSU 2025 in the Datathon category where my teammates and I took 1st place! I've
			also had the honor of representing Westminster at NCWIT 2023, 2024, and 2025 as a college panelist!
		</p>
		<p class="new-line">Research projects I've worked on as an undergraduate researcher:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Official Westminster University Computer Science Department Discord Server with Dr. Helen Hu</li>
			<li>
				Problems and solutions guides for Module 2 and Module 4 in
				<em>A Quantitative Reasoning for Social Justice Active Learning Textbook</em>
				with Dr. Bianca Thompson
			</li>
			<li>Circuit diagram drawing and modeling software for CMPT 328 with Shreeya Maskey and Dr. Kathryn Lenth</li>

		<h1 class="center new-line">Some Things I've Worked On / Am Working On Independently</h1>
		<h2 class="center new-line">These are just a couple of my projects — my GitHub is most likely up to date with my latest activity.</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>This website! The original version used PHP, but I have since rewritten the codebase to use Angular!</li>
			<li>
				From Scratch Database: A recreation of a SQL database using Rust to create, read, update, and delete from CSV files. I'm aiming to
				have this database do almost anything a SQL database can do, including but not limited to full joins, aggregations, SQL math,
				aliasing, and transactions. Possibly even more functions that I may or may not need in some upcoming projects.

			</div>
			<li>
				ChessWeb: A Django web app for Oakwood Elementary's Chess Club that uses a SQLite database to hold player information such as their
				name and rating (ELO). This program uses a greedy algorithm to pair players based on their ratings and updates their ratings based on
				the results of their previous games. You can find the code on my GitHub — it's in pre-release!

			<li>
				3D Visualizer: A 3D plotter for prey-predator equations, using Three.js to approximate the populations with either Euler's Method or
				Runge-Kutta 4. This was completed as my final project with Brynlee Thain for our Differential Equations class! You can either visit
				GitHub for the source code or <a class="end" id="link" href="/3d" target="_blank">go to the web version</a>.

		<h1 class="new-line">Chess and Video Games</h1>
		<p class="new-line indent">
			I believe what got me into Computer Science was truly my love for video games. I grew up playing chess at my local elementary's chess club
			when I was around 8 (I had started playing at 5), which then spiraled into my parents encouraging me to play other educational games. I
			vividly remember playing a submarine game where you had to solve math problems to progress.
		</p>
		<p class="new-line indent">
			After a bit of begging, they gave in and I was just playing regular old video games like Mario Kart. I would spend hours grinding away in
			Pokémon (which then led me to discover the 3DS modding scene around 2015–2016), and the rest is history. I'm an avid modder of Nintendo
			and PlayStation handhelds and consoles. So far, I've modded a bunch of 3DS systems, a couple of Nintendo Switches, Wii and Wii U consoles,
			a PSP 3000, and a PS Vita.

		<h1 class="new-line">A Hopeful Full Stack Developer in the Making!</h1>
		<p class="new-line indent">
			At the moment, I've built a bunch of web applications using LAMP, Django, Angular + Nest.js, and React. Some of them use a database, like
			the LAMP version of ChessWeb, which was my final for my database class (later rewritten in Django using SQLite). I've also worked on both
			PHP and Angular apps via my internships at RanLife and Ken Garff Automotive, respectively.
		</p>
		<p class="new-line indent">
			Beyond web development, I've worked on applications using Java, Python, C/C++, Rust, PHP, and briefly explored other languages like
			Clojure, Scala, Pascal, and Haskell. I've set up and maintained Linux servers running Apache, Ubuntu, and Red Hat. I've also worked with
			Raspberry Pi (doing SMS texting with Python scripts) and Arduino boards with robotics. I’ve dabbled in Blender and Fusion 360 for creating
			3D models that I print out.
		</p>
		<p class="new-line indent">
			I'm hoping to also dive into other niche projects like Godot game development or other random projects I spin up every month or so.
