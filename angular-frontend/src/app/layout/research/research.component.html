			<h1>CircuitCraft: An Innovative Way of Drawing Circuits</h1>
			<h2>React, React Flow, Agile Development, Web Application</h2>
			<p>
				After taking CMPT 328: Computer Architecture, I realized how difficult it is for students to digitally create and submit circuit
				diagrams. Alongside Shreeya Maskey and under the guidance of Dr. Kathryn Lenth, we decided to build a tool specifically for students:
				CircuitCraft. The goal was to create an easier and faster way for students to design circuits on their own devices and submit their
				work for in-class activities and homework.
			</p>
			<p>
				The largest challenge with this project was designing a simple, intuitive user experience that streamlined the task of creating
				diagrams that can range from simplistic to complex. We had to work through many ideas on how best to implement our designs while also
				making sure to incorporate feedback from our user testing.
			</p>
			<p>
				The application was built using React and React Flow, a powerful sub-library for node-based editors. Everything was designed to be
				lightweight and fully client-side to minimize server impact.
			</p>
			<p>
				This tool will officially be used in the Spring 2026 CMPT 328 course at Westminster University, and I'm excited to see it help
				students learn Computer Architecture more efficiently!

			<h1><em>A Quantitative Reasoning for Social Justice Active Learning Textbook</em></h1>
			<h2>Curriculum Development, Math Education, Social Justice</h2>
			<p>
				While taking the "Social Justice by the Numbers" course in my first semester, I was given an opportunity to help improve the course
				material itself. Working with Dr. Bianca Thompson, I contributed to developing an active learning textbook designed to make
				quantitative reasoning more accessible and meaningful for all students, while also streamlining the professors' experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				The biggest challenge with this project was writing exercises that balanced depth and accessibility. I needed to create enough
				problems for instructors to choose from, but also design each exercise to feel achievable — even for students who may not enjoy math.
			</p>
			<p>
				All solution guides were built in Google Docs, with supplementary calculators created in Google Sheets. I drew heavily on my own
				experiences as a student to craft questions that framed social justice issues through approachable mathematical analysis.
			</p>
			<p>
				My work will be officially used starting Fall 2024 for the "Social Justice by the Numbers" course, helping to make quantitative
				reasoning more inclusive and empowering for the next generation of students.

			<h1>Westminster Computer Science Department Discord Server</h1>
			<h2>Community Building, Discord Admin Tools, Student Engagement</h2>
			<p>
				When Westminster's Computer Science Department needed a better way to communicate after Slack changed its free-tier policies, I was
				tasked by Dr. Helen Hu to design a new solution. That solution became the official CS Department Discord server.
			</p>
			<p>
				The biggest challenge was ensuring the server was easy to use for everyone — even those new to Discord. Setting up correct
				permissions, designing class-specific channels, and building an organized community structure took a lot of iteration and feedback.
			</p>
			<p>
				We relied on Discord itself plus moderation tools like Mee6, Dyno, and EasyPoll to automate tasks and keep the environment safe and
				welcoming. I also wrote extensive user guides to help students and professors navigate the new system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, the Discord server is used by all Computer Science classes for announcements, homework questions, and department events. My
				current research focuses on growing community engagement, starting with hosting events like a Mario Kart Tournament in Fall 2024!
